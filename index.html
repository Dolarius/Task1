        <div class="lightblueSubTitle">Knowledge management has always been interwined with the work of Asian Developement Bank (ADB).</div>
        <div class="lightblueDescription">How that came to be is a story that deserves to be told. It begins with a vision as old as the institution itself: to create a bank that is not just a source of development funding, but also a valued source of applied expertise and knowledge. Since its founding in 1966, ADB's commitment to build a knowledge base out of its vast experience steadily increased and led to the creation of a knowledge management framework in 2004. This contributed to shaping a provision in Strategy 2020 that ensured ADB would play a larager role in harnessing knowledge to promote development across Asia and the Pacific.</div>
